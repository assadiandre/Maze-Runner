About: 

This was a multiplayer game that I built in my Computer Science A class at Berkeley High. The game was built over
a period of two-weeks. The game is simple, one person is a chaser, and the other is a runner. The goal is to catch your opponent and avoid the obstacles as they slow you down. 

Media: 

This is a demo of the multiplayer feature. The two client windows are communicating via Firebase servers.
